# Acrogen
For those tired of having to come up with snazzy acronyms by themselves. 

Simply use this script with the name of a text file containing a project specification or elevator pitch and watch as it churns out possible acronyms. 

All acronyms are valid english words and are composed of the essential terms from the input file

WARNING: Do not use without human supervision. The acronyms generated by this tool are meant (at least for now) as a starting point. Many might be nonsensical - but some might be gold. 

Flags:

-c : specifies the text file to use as the corpus

-s : specifies the size of the acornyms to generate

-p : when active, prints all acronyms to terminal

-o : specifies file to write acronyms to

Example Usage:
./acrogen -s 4 -c exampleCorpus -p -o outputFile
